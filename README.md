# Decoder Ring

This project allows users to encode or decode text using Caesar's Shift, Polybius Square, and Substitution ciphers. I used Test Driven Development with JavaScript to produce code, develop unit tests with Mocha and Chai, and handle errors. I also learned how to use regular expressions and developed proficiency writing modular code for helper functions.
